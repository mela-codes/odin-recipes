    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Struggle to make perfect soft-boiled eggs with a runny centre? Just follow our foolproof recipe, then serve with toast soldiers or in a salad niçoise</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Salt & Pepper</li>
        <li>Toast</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Fill a medium sized saucepan with water and bring to a rolling boil.</li>

        <li>Make sure your eggs aren't fridge cold. By having the eggs at room temperature, it will be less of a shock for the egg reaching the hot water and therefore less likely to crack. You can also use an egg pricker to make a very small hole in each egg before boiling, which will also reduce the chances of it cracking in the heat. Slowly lower the eggs into the water using a spoon.</li>

        <li>Set your timer for 4-5 mins for runny/dippy eggs to serve with soldiers, or 6-7 mins for soft-boiled eggs for a salad. If serving in a salad, plunge the eggs into a bowl of cold water as soon as the timer goes off – this will stop them cooking and cool the shells quickly for peeling.</li>
    </ul>
